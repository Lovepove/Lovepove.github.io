<ul>
<li>
<p>The project was very interesting and the feeling of it differed from other projects as it felt like we were solving real problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was very fun and rewarding to work towards real hardware instead of just using software and simulators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What we had the most trouble with was some of the small details and kinks in Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For example we spent a couple of hours trying to figure out why object.getGraphics() returned null.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another example is where we spent 3 hours getting one byte too few and getting errors until we realized that the byte signed itself and therefore was doing strange things to our logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One problem we had was when we tried to engage all 8 cameras. The GUI had room for all 8 but for some reason they only showed the video feed in 4 places and then overlapped so we had 8 video feeds but only in 4 positions, giving us flickering pictures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another problem we encountered was to get the correct GUIlayout. The images updated correctly if we didn’t have a layout that put the text below the pictures. After some fiddling, java magically fixed this problem for us. We have no idea how it came to be or how it was fixed. Software engineering rocks!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*The cameras became increasingly difficult to use because of the heavy loads they were under the day before the deadline.</p>
<p>*We understand the server/client structure much better now. We had a completely different design in mind for the client and server when we started and that cost us a lot of time.</p>
